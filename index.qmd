# Preface

This book contains my tips-for-future-me regarding how I like to build and maintain my workflow with R. It began as a series of Quarto docs I kept in an RProject for me to refer back to whenever I forgot how I had done something or which git command I used to achieve something. It is informal and likely flawed. I make an effort to provide links to source of important info where relevant.

These documents were originally intended to be privately used. I'll slowly brush them up to improve readibly/quality, but this is definitely a work-in-progress.
